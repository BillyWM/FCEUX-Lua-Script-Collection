(ALL numbers are hex, even those not prefixed with 0x)

Clock on top of school at beginning of game has this tile pattern for its middle portion:

	12 32 33 21

That same sequence is found in the ROM at 0x05F4

Sky to the left of tower:

	02 02 08

That sequence occurs at 0x05EC

This level data is preceded by:

	A9B8A9B8 A9B8A9B8 A9B8A9B8 9C9B9C9B 9C9B9C9B 9C9B9C9B

This sequence, although with different repetition lengths, also occurs a small bit further up, various times

Meaning unknown.

The leftmost bike rack is the sequence:

	74 83 AB 92

at 0x076C. After this is many repetitions of 62 (shaded ground), followed by a few bytes for the reflection of the gate
	then more shaded ground, then more bike rack. The final bike rack sequence appears to describe only one section. It
	is not repeated if modified.

	A second bike rack sequence (AB 80 83) appears at 0x08CC
	And another at 0x0A2D

At 0x078C starts a long sequence of 01, representing normal ground

	This sequence seems to be copied to all the rows of the ground, then repeated twice. For the third area of
		the level, it only is copied to the top row. The others remain normal ground rather than whatever it's hacked to










First mall:
	0x0D0C - Sky (series of 14 14....)
	0x0E6C - Bottom of first shop (69 38 AE...)
		runs until 0x0E8B, describing first two shops. Does not describe Sushi restaruant. Delimited by AA AA 00 00 instead
	0x0B4C - Sushi restaurant (sky above it)
		This block describes two shops (sushi + bookstore to the right)
		runs until 0x0CCB, the bottom of the pole at the right of the area. Delimited by AA AA 00 00
		Yes, these are the 3rd and 4th shops, and they come earlier in the ROM!
