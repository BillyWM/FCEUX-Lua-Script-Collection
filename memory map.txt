No RAM map was available so I started figuring it on my own.
These are some messy notes describing what I could discover so far
- Billy Wenge-Murphy

===========================================================
(1b) is a one byte value, (2b) is 2
Addresses are in hexadecimal but not denoted with 0x
Values in hex ARE denoted with 0x, otherwise assume they're decimal


All 1 byte. Player 2's stats are next byte after each.

Punch:			049F
Kick:			04A3
Weapon:			04A7
Throwing:		04AB
Agility:		04AF
Defense: 		04B3
Strength:		04B7
Willpower:		04BB
Stamina:		04BF
Max power:		04C3
Money:
	04C7	Lower cents digit
	04C8	Lower dollars digit
	04C9	Upper two dollars digits
		These money values are stored in a really strange way described here:

Inventory:		064D - 0654


Shops:

	0036:
		Related to entering doors 0 normally. Tracks the process of entering a shop or other door
			not just the related animation
		For shops with animated doors:
			changes with animation: 0, 41, 58, 59, 123
			Setting 123, for example, will immediately pop you inside a shop. Usually this appears
				to be the last shop you visited, unless you move from one town to another
		Shops without animated doors:
			changes to 72 once inside
		Other doors:
			0, 41, 58, 59, then back to 0 on the other side.
			123 and 72 mark sub-areas, then?
		No change when zoning between normal areas (walking off side of screen)
	0084: Shopkeeper position (normally 0x1E?)
	00CC:
		Shop sprite pointer (of some kind). Messing with value loads in different graphics for shopkeeper
		0 while outside shops
	00CB: Player graphic while in shop. Varies by shop (most are broken graphics). These work for bookstore:
		0x1A Normal
		0x1C Bowl of rice
		0x20 Weapon
		0x23 Hamburger


Sprites (any/general):

	02E3 (1b): Screen-relative X pos
		Where a sprite is in the viewable area.

NPC positions:

	0084 - 0086 (1b): X position of an NPC
	008E, 008F (1b): Area section of NPC
		(see below under "Player 1" for explanation)
	0089: item x pos
	00A0, 00A1 (1b): Y pos of NPC
	00A9, 00AA (1b): NPC visibility? (set to > 1 for invisible)
	02B9, 02BD (1b): Animation tracker of sprite. Toggles back and forth as sprites walk in place (by cheat/lock X pos)

	006A:
	052A: Each is a walking animation tracker (?) of an NPC
		(Freezing this value allows the sprites to continue to move, but they glide)
	03CF: Whether item is picked up?



Player 1:

	0083 (1b): X pos
	008C (1b): Area section
		X position only goes 0-255, so this tells you which 256px section the player is in
		Starts with 0 on the left
	009E (1b): Y pos (up is higher, down is lower!)

	00A7: Player invisibility? (set to 0x40 and became invisible)

	0005: Facing?
		64 right
		0 left
		252? At moment of dashing into right edge of screen? (right before fall)
	001E: Physics/status tracker:
		0x10 - Normal
		0x0F - Falling (very rapidly switches between other values while about to hit ground)
		0x0F - (Also!) standing up on a ledge
		0x00 - Lying on ground
		0x00 - (Also!) touching left edge of screen
		0xFF - Touching right edge of screen
			IMPORTANT NOTE: Flips between MANY values with NPCs around, including enemies, townfolk
				and coins. Does not flip between values for unmoving items, but does for
				moving (thrown) items, or items player is hitting with
	004F: Moving flag
		0x81 while moving, 0x80 otherwise
	005D: Running physics tracker
		128 while running (either direction)
		32 while stopping
		0 stopped
		192 while leaping (jumping after running start, or falling from hitting a wall)
		64 while jumping (straight up)
	0068: Walked/ran distance tracker
		Continues to increment while moving (including if you quickly change directions without stopping)
		Resets to 0 on stop
		
	00D3: Animation frame tracker.
		Rapidly flips between values as animation plays:
			0x00, 0x01, 0x02 walking left	(0x00 facing left)
			0x80, 0x81, 0x82 walking right	(0x80 facing right)
			0xA1 - 0xA3 Puncing right
			0x21 - 0x23 Punching left
			0x24 - 0x26 Kicking left
			0xA4 - 0xA6 Kicking right
			0x0A - Jumping (left)
			0x8A - Jumping (right)
			0x0C/0x8C - Touching ground when landing
	006F (1b): Facing?
			128 left, 0 right.
			Retains prev value walking up/down
	04D4 (1b): Facing?
			1 right, 2 left.
			Retains prev value walking up/down
	030F (1b): Facing? (including up-down). Here facing means direction they last moved, or are moving
		192 left
		64 right
		0 up
		128 down
		160 down-left
		32 up-right
		96 down-right
		224 up-left

		(Seem like bit flags, obviously)

	032D (1b): Another direction tracker. Value depends on facing
		160 down (facing right)
		64	down (facing left)
		96	up (facing left)
		192 up (facing right)
		32 diagonally down (either one)
		224 diagonally up (either one)
		
		
	0335 (1b): Up/down walk flag?
		1 when moving (or moved) up, 254 down, 0 left/right
	0388 (2b): X pos (different value)
	03C9 (1b): Key press (and release) counter. Increments when press arrow, or release


Other:

	003F (1b): Pause menu status
		160 when paused
		96 menu sliding in
		64 menu sliding out
		0 not paused

	0042: Area tracker
		Goes from 0x00 (beginning) to 0x22 (final rooftop)
		Keeps value while in shops

		Switching this while in one area will immediately cause it to start behaving like the new area including
			collisions and hotspots (i.e. leaving area, pits, going in shops, etc). Will scroll in broken
			graphics when screen scrolls, and can even make (non-broken) townfolk suddenly appear

	0497: Hit timer
		Counts up by 1 per second while player takes no blows from enemies
		Goes down significantly per blow, but not necessarily to 0
		Freezes while in town. (only?) activates again when enemy is around.

	03EB: Enemy dealt damage counter?
		Increases when an enemy hits the player. Each enemy seems to have their own count: changes back and forth
			as enemies take turns dealing blows. Seems to be some kind of working RAM, storing a damage value
			from elsewhere.

	00DC (1b): Screen scroll
	00F6 (1b): Also screen scroll? (stores identical value)

	003D: Scroll section
		Like the section tracker for player, but related to scroll offset.
		Related addr: 00DC
